# Capture

Capture is the only layer that touches the outside world. It produces one JSON file per observation into `~/.openchronicle/capture-buffer/`; nothing above it ever talks to macOS directly.

## Two signal sources

**`mac-ax-watcher`** (primary, event-driven). A vendored Swift binary that subscribes to AX notifications across all running apps: window focus, value changes (typing), title changes, app activation. It emits one JSON object per event on stdout. The Python side reads that stream line-by-line in `capture/watcher.py` → `capture/event_dispatcher.py`.

**Heartbeat timer** (fallback). Every `heartbeat_minutes` (default 10), the scheduler fires a capture even if no event arrived — so long idle periods leave a trail. Set `heartbeat_minutes = 0` to disable entirely (watcher-only); values `>0` are clamped to a 60-second floor.

Both funnel into `capture_once` in `capture/scheduler.py`, which runs:

1. `ax_capture.capture_frontmost(focused_window_only=True)` — one-shot tree for the current window (macOS: `mac-ax-helper`; Windows: pywinauto UIA), pruned to `ax_depth` layers.
2. `s1_parser.enrich()` — extracts `focused_element`, `visible_text`, and `url` from the AX tree (see [S1 fields](#s1-fields) below).
3. `screenshot.grab()` — unless `include_screenshot = false`.
4. `window_meta.active_window()` — app name, title, bundle_id (macOS: `NSRunningApplication`; Windows: foreground Win32 metadata).
5. Write `{iso8601_safe}.json` to the buffer.

The filename is ISO-8601 with `:` → `-` and `+` → `p` / `-` → `m` for the TZ offset. Example: `2026-04-21T17-07-32p08-00.json`.

The same capture scheduler also invokes `SessionManager.on_event` (wired as a `pre_capture_hook` in `daemon.py`), so the session cutter sees every capture-worthy event without a separate subscription path.

## Debounce / dedup / gap

Four time-based knobs throttle the event firehose (`capture/event_dispatcher.py`):

| Knob | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `debounce_seconds` | 3.0 | `AXValueChanged` events within this window collapse — only the last triggers a capture. Prevents one-capture-per-keystroke during typing. |
| `dedup_interval_seconds` | 1.0 | Same `(event_type, app)` pair within this window is dropped outright. |
| `min_capture_gap_seconds` | 2.0 | Hard floor between consecutive `capture_once` calls, regardless of event reason. |
| `same_window_dedup_seconds` | 5.0 | Non-focus-change events in the same `(bundle_id, title)` pair collapse within this window. Focus changes always bypass it. |

Tune these if you see `capture.log` flooded; the defaults produce a few hundred captures per work-day, comfortably under the buffer retention.

### Content dedup (no time window)

On top of the time-based knobs, the scheduler compares each built capture against the previous one by a content fingerprint (`hash(bundle + title + focused_element.value + visible_text + url)`, in `capture/scheduler.py`). If the fingerprint matches, the capture is **not** written and the session manager's `pre_capture_hook` is **not** fired.

This catches the case the time knobs can't: a screen that doesn't change (lock screen overnight, a paused video, an idle IDE) keeps generating AX events with the same content indefinitely. Without content-dedup those would both fill the buffer and keep the current session from ever idling out. Timestamps, triggers, and screenshots are excluded from the fingerprint so only meaningful changes count.

## AX depth — the #1 footgun

AX Trees for native Cocoa apps are shallow (5–15 layers). Electron apps (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Slack, Notion) nest user content 20–60 layers deep under chrome.

**Default `ax_depth = 100`** was chosen after diagnosing silent capture misses: a 90-second Claude Desktop conversation about an interview at 18:00 was producing captures where "18:00" appeared at character 5639 of the tree — past any reasonable prune limit. At depth 8, the tree contained only window chrome and sidebar headers; at depth 100, the full conversation was there.

If you're running on limited hardware and only care about native apps, lowering to 30 is safe. Don't go below 20.

Diagnostic:

```bash
./resources/mac-ax-helper --app-name Claude --depth 30 --raw | wc -c
# vs.
./resources/mac-ax-helper --app-name Claude --depth 100 --raw | wc -c
```

A 10×+ ratio means there's content past depth 30 you'd miss.

## What's in a capture file

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-21T17:07:32+08:00",
  "schema_version": 2,
  "trigger": { "event_type": "window_focus_changed", "app": "Claude", ... },
  "window_meta": {
    "app_name": "Claude",
    "bundle_id": "com.anthropic.claudefordesktop",
    "title": "New conversation — Claude"
  },
  "focused_element": {
    "role": "AXTextArea",
    "title": "Message composer",
    "value": "I have an interview at 18:00",
    "is_editable": true,
    "value_length": 30
  },
  "visible_text": "### New conversation — Claude\n...",
  "url": null,
  "ax_tree": { ... pruned tree with roles, titles, values ... },
  "ax_metadata": { ... },
  "screenshot": {
    "image_base64": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...",
    "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1200
  }
}
```

`trigger` is `{"event_type": "heartbeat"}` for timer captures and `{"event_type": "manual"}` for `capture-once`. Screenshot is omitted entirely when `include_screenshot = false`.

Secure fields (password inputs) are replaced with `"[REDACTED]"` during native capture (macOS AX helper / Windows UIA) — the Python enrich step never sees raw secrets.

## Windows capture

On Windows, the one-shot UI Automation tree uses **pywinauto** (UIA backend) in-process. The emitted JSON matches the historical AX-tree shape consumed by `s1_parser` and the timeline. **pywinauto** is a Windows-only dependency in `pyproject.toml`; install it if you run from a source checkout without resolving extras.

## S1 fields

Ported from Einsia-Partner's `s1_collector`. These are what downstream LLM stages consume — the raw `ax_tree` is kept only for future vision-model support and debugging.

- **`focused_element`** — `{role, title, value, is_editable, value_length}` for the currently focused AX element. This is the user's cursor context: what they're typing into, which sidebar row is selected, etc.
- **`visible_text`** — a length-capped markdown rendering of the AX tree (up to ~10 k chars). What the user is currently reading on screen.
- **`url`** — regex-extracted from `visible_text` when present; `null` otherwise.

Screenshots live in the capture JSON but are **not** passed to the timeline / reducer / classifier prompts. They exist for future vision-model paths and for debugging.

## Buffer hygiene — tiered retention

Captures are pruned by the timeline tick, not the writer. After each timeline scan, `capture_scheduler.cleanup_buffer` applies three passes (oldest-safe-first), all gated on "this file has already been absorbed by a closed timeline block" so un-absorbed trailing captures are never touched:

| Pass | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Delete** | mtime older than `buffer_retention_hours` (default **168** = 7 days) | Whole JSON removed |
| **Strip screenshot** | mtime older than `screenshot_retention_hours` (default **24**) | Rewrite JSON without `screenshot` field; sets `screenshot_stripped: true`. The AX tree, `visible_text`, `focused_element`, and `url` stay |
| **Evict by size** | Total buffer > `buffer_max_mb` (default **2000**, i.e. 2 GB; `0` disables) | Delete oldest absorbed files until under the cap |

Why tiered: the screenshot base64 is ~77% of each capture's bytes but nothing downstream consumes it today (it's kept for future vision stages + debugging). Stripping it at 24h drops each stale capture to ~20% of its original size, which is what makes a 7-day window affordable. Typical steady-state footprint is in the 100s of MB.

To wipe manually:

```bash
openchronicle clean captures
```

## Search index — `captures_fts`

Every successful capture write is also indexed into an FTS5 virtual table (`captures_fts`, backed by a `captures` content table — see `src/openchronicle/store/fts.py`). This is what powers the MCP `search_captures` and `current_context` tools, which let LLM clients reach the raw screen content directly without having to scan JSON files on disk.

**Lifecycle.**

| Event | Effect on index |
|---|---|
| `_write_capture` (write-through) | Upsert one row into `captures` (`INSERT OR REPLACE` on the file stem). Triggers keep `captures_fts` in sync. |
| `cleanup_buffer` time-based delete | Each removed JSON file → `delete_capture(stem)` → trigger drops the FTS row. |
| `cleanup_buffer` size-based eviction | Same — each evicted file is also removed from FTS. |
| Screenshot strip | **Untouched.** Strip only removes the base64 image; the indexed text (`visible_text`, `focused_value`, `window_title`, `app_name`, `url`) is unchanged. |
| `openchronicle rebuild-captures-index` | Backfill from `~/.openchronicle/capture-buffer/*.json`. Idempotent (`INSERT OR REPLACE`). Run once after upgrading onto a populated buffer, or any time the index drifts. |

**Indexed columns.** Only the searchable text is in FTS: `app_name`, `window_title`, `focused_value`, `visible_text`, `url`. Filterable metadata (timestamp, bundle_id, focused_role) lives on the `captures` table for `WHERE`-clause filtering. Screenshots are deliberately not duplicated — the JSON file on disk stays the authoritative copy of the raw image bytes.

**Tokenizer.** `unicode61 remove_diacritics 2` — case-insensitive, accent-folded, Unicode-aware. Same setup as the compressed-memory `entries` index.

If `captures_fts` falls out of sync (e.g. capture worker crashed mid-write, or the daemon was killed during cleanup), the index is recoverable in one shot:

```bash
openchronicle rebuild-captures-index
```

## Pause

```bash
openchronicle pause
```

Drops a `~/.openchronicle/.paused` sentinel. The watcher keeps streaming but `capture_once` short-circuits on sentinel presence. `resume` removes the sentinel.

## Smoke test

```bash
openchronicle capture-once
```

Writes one capture immediately, prints its path. Good for confirming Accessibility permission is granted and the helper compiled correctly.
