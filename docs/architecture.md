# Architecture

OpenChronicle is a single daemon that ingests capture events, compresses them through a deterministic funnel, and classifies the result into durable Markdown memory. There is only one ingestion path — no modes.

## Runtime sequence

A typical 5-minute flush window, showing how one AX event propagates through to durable memory:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as mac-ax-watcher
    participant S0 as S0 dispatcher
    participant S1 as S1 parser
    participant BUF as capture-buffer
    participant SM as Session mgr
    participant TL as Timeline tick
    participant R as S2 reducer
    participant CLF as Classifier
    participant DB as SQLite + memory/
    participant MCP as MCP / agent

    W->>S0: AX event
    S0->>S0: debounce / dedup / min-gap
    S0->>S1: schedule capture runner (threaded)
    S1->>BUF: write enriched {iso}.json
    Note right of BUF: content-fingerprint dedup<br/>drops consecutive duplicates
    BUF->>SM: pre_capture_hook → on_event<br/>(post-write · skipped on content-dedup)

    Note over TL,BUF: timeline tick · every 60 s
    TL->>BUF: scan closed 1-min windows
    TL->>DB: LLM → insert timeline_blocks

    Note over SM,R: flush tick · every 5 min
    SM->>R: reduce(flush_end → now)
    R->>DB: read blocks · LLM · append [flush] entry
    R->>SM: advance flush_end

    Note over CLF,DB: classifier tick · every 30 min
    CLF->>DB: read event-daily (tagged sid:)<br/>+ timeline_blocks in window (grounding)
    CLF->>DB: LLM tool-call loop → update memory files
    CLF->>SM: advance classified_end

    Note over SM,CLF: on_session_end<br/>(idle / soft-cut / timeout / shutdown / 23:55)
    SM->>R: terminal reduce (full trailing range)
    R->>DB: final entry

    CLF->>DB: classify trailing window

    Note over MCP,DB: any time

## Tasks in the daemon

Defined in `src/openchronicle/daemon.py`.

| Task | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `capture` | Consumes `mac-ax-watcher` events, debounces, writes enriched JSON captures (incl. S1 fields) to `~/.openchronicle/capture-buffer/`. Heartbeat catches quiet periods. Also calls `SessionManager.on_event` on every capture so the session cutter sees the same signal. |
| `timeline` | Every 60s scans for closed wall-clock windows (default 1 min) and runs the `timeline` LLM stage to normalize each window while preserving authored text verbatim. Cleans buffer files older than the newest block. |
| `session` | Every `session.tick_seconds` (default 30), calls `SessionManager.check_cuts()` so idle-gap and timeout cuts fire even when the dispatcher is quiet. |
| `flush` | Every `session.flush_minutes` (default 5, clamped to 5-min floor), runs the reducer incrementally over the active session's newly closed timeline blocks (~5 of them at defaults) and appends `[flush]`-tagged partial entries to today's event-daily. |
| `classifier-tick` | Every `classifier.interval_minutes` (default 30, min 5), runs the classifier over any event-daily entries appended since the session's `classified_end` bookmark. Silent no-op when no new entries have landed. |
| `daily-safety-net` | Once per local day at `reducer.daily_tick_hour:minute` (default 23:55), force-ends the currently-open session and reduces every stranded `ended`/`failed` session row — the "we survived a crash or midnight rollover" safety net. |
| `mcp` | Hosts the Reader MCP server inside the daemon. Exponential backoff on crash. |

The session cutter itself doesn't have a dedicated task — it runs inline on every capture via the `pre_capture_hook` wired in `daemon.py`. Session-end callbacks spawn the reducer on a daemon thread, which then fires the terminal classifier via its success callback (covering any trailing window the 30-min tick didn't reach). Each session's progress on both stages is bookkept on its sessions row: `flush_end` for the reducer, `classified_end` for the classifier.

`--capture-only` disables the timeline aggregator and MCP server. Capture, session, and the daily-safety-net still run so session rows land on disk.

## The session boundary

Three rules (ported verbatim from Einsia-Partner), all enforced in `session/manager.py`:

1. **Hard cut.** No capture-worthy events for `session.gap_minutes` (default 5) → close the session at the last event's timestamp.
2. **Soft cut.** A single unrelated app is focused for `session.soft_cut_minutes` (default 3) unless ≥2 distinct apps were focused in the preceding 2 minutes (frequent-switching defuses the rule).
3. **Timeout.** A session older than `session.max_session_hours` (default 2) is force-cut regardless.

Force-end is also called on daemon shutdown and on the 23:55 safety net, so a session never outlives the process that opened it.

SQLite is opened with WAL mode — the MCP reader and the writer paths coexist without blocking.

## Why this shape

- **Compression first, classification second.** S1 → Timeline → S2 is a deterministic funnel with bounded prompt size at each step. By the time the classifier runs it sees a session-level summary, not raw AX snapshots — so there is no "is this worth writing?" triage call; the classifier just extracts any durable facts it finds, or skips.
- **Session as the natural unit.** A "session" — a bounded chunk of focused work — is what humans remember. Cutting on idle / app-switch / timeout produces event-daily entries with accurate time ranges, which solves the v1 problem of long sessions being under-reported after the first append.
- **Periodic classifier, bookmarked.** The classifier fires on a 30-min interval during each active session, then one last trailing-window pass at session end. Each pass advances the session's `classified_end` bookmark, so entries are never double-classified and long sessions produce durable facts without waiting to close.
- **Daily event files.** `event-YYYY-MM-DD.md` sorts alphabetically by day. Weekly files from v1 are left untouched — they stay searchable via FTS.
- **One process, many tasks.** Avoids IPC overhead and keeps `index.db` single-writer in practice. SQLite WAL gives the MCP reader what it needs.
- **MCP inside the daemon.** External MCP clients get a stable localhost URL instead of spawning a fresh stdio subprocess per session.
